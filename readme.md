This is a variant of the [Dog board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2633/dog) which uses Caves family rules.

Other rule sets:

- https://tesera.ru/images/items/1136132/DOG_Schmidt_English.pdf

Specific rule variations:
- Come out cards (1/11 and 13) use the number on their card as their distance to come out, instead of just coming out to the start space.  1 will still come out to the start space, but 11 and 13 will go further.
- You cannot pass over a piece in the home area.  Pawns must move forward to allow more pieces to enter.
- Played with 4 or 6 players
- Jokers (? cards) can be played as any red card, but not as blue cards.
